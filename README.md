tweaking information

Tweaking means to improve (a mechanism or system) by making fine adjustments to it. For Windows gaming the majority of the operating system is actually bloatware which isn't needed, to solve this we tweak the operating system to remove bloatware to make the operating system more lightweight. An example of this is disabling services. Services run in the background and hog the performance when it isn't necessary for it to always run in the background, when disabling services you shoudn't just randomly disable services but instead you should learn what the service your disabling does and if it's using cycle deltas.
