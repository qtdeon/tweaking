# tweaking
basic tweaking information

THIS GUIDE ISN'T THAT ADVANCED AND THERE IS MANY GUIDES WHICH GOES MORE IN DETAIL WAY MORE!


People too often rely on tweaking then actually skill and think that tweaking can just immediately make them a "pro player" and instead of practicing they scroll through youtube or twitter looking for tweaks which they don't even know what it does. Tweaking means to improve (a mechanism or system) by making fine adjustments to it. For Windows gaming the majority of the operating system is actually bloatware which isn't needed, to solve this we tweak the operating system to remove bloatware to make the operating system more lightweight. An example of this is disabling services. Services run in the background and hog the performance when it isn't necessary for it to always run in the background, when disabling services you shoudn't just randomly disable services but instead you should learn what the service your disabling does and if it's using cycles delta. 

If you are looking for a huge performance gain you should invest your time into overclocking (can shorten life span of components) or upgrade components in your pc because tweaks aren't magical. Or if you are willing to do something risky then you can scewin/grub your motherboard however there is the chance that it can brick your motherboard if you are not careful with what you are doing. (Scewin/Grub is what you use to change hidden bios settings however I won't explain much about it because there already is some guides about it)

PERSONAL OPINION: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON TWEAKING SERVICES/PROGRAMS, THE TWEAKS THEY USE ARE ALL OPEN-SOURCE AND CAN BE FOUND SOMEWHERE BECAUSE TWEAKING KNOWLEDGE IS FREE ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST LOOK!
